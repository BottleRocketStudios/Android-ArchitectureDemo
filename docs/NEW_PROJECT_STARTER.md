New Project Starter
===================

## Loose overview of New Project setup steps
1. Copy architecture demo source to an empty git repository
2. Commit the initial changes
3. Delete architecture demo specific data (classes, Android resources)
4. Refactor project names in the codebase
5. Update other relevant project data
6. Commit changes
7. Gradual replacement of unused data once project specific data is added (classes, dependencies, Android resources)

## Prerequisites
Things you should have prior to starting the new project setup. These can be changed later but it is better to have them now if possible.

### Immediate
* desired applicationId
* desired packagename

### Optional
* Application icon assets (can replace with generic icons generated by Android Studio until received)

## Detailed New Project Setup steps
### Copy architecture demo source to an empty git repository
Copy the existing files/folders (with the exception of the `.git` folder) into a new, empty git repository

### Delete architecture demo specific data (classes, Android resources)
* In general, remove all unused Architecture Demo specific Fragments, ViewModels, Repositories, and Android resources(layouts, colors, drawables, color drawables, menus, styles, strings, etc). Keep `BaseFragment`, `BaseViewModel`, and `Repository (interface)`.
* In the app module specifically, remove `.ui.repository`, `.ui.snippet`, `.ui.user`, `.ui.auth`, and `.ui.home`
* In the data module specifically, remove all Arch Demo specific models in `.data.model` (keep `DomainModel`, `Dto`, `ServerError`, and the `ResponseToApiResultMapper` if you will be using Retrofit), `BitbucketRepository` in `.data.repository` (and `DateTimeAdapter` if you aren't going to need/use it)
* Remove all unit tests covering removed functionality

### Refactor project names in the codebase
* Replace existing applicationId with new applicationId in app `build.gradle.kts` productFlavors block
1. * Update project build types/variants table application ids in [BEST_PRACTICES.md](BEST_PRACTICES.md)
* Update brand named used for the apk in the app `build.gradle.kts`
* Refactor app and data packagenames
* Adjust project name in `settings.gradle.kts`
* Adjust app name in `strings.xml`

### Update other relevant project data
* Update version number to appropriate starting point if not `1.0.0` in the app `build.gradle.kts`
* Update the `MIN_SDK` value in `Dependencies.kt` (as needed)
* Replace existing `debug.keystore` with a newly generated a new debug keystore (optional). See https://gist.github.com/henriquemenezes/70feb8fff20a19a65346e48786bedb8f#debug-keystore

### Gradual replacement of unused data once project specific data is added (classes, dependencies, Android resources)
* As the new project grows over time, all of the architecture demo specific code and dependencies (relating to bitbucket repository management) should be removed.
